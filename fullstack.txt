Front-end framework & bundler
Vite + React (with TypeScript)

Why: Lightning‐fast dev server, instant HMR, and out-of-the-box support for TS, JSX, and code-splitting.

Getting started:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm create vite@latest my-platformer -- --template react-ts
cd my-platformer
npm install
Game engine
Phaser 3

Why: Battle-tested 2D HTML5 game framework with Scenes, arcade physics, tilemaps, sprites, and easy asset loading.

Integration:

npm install phaser

In your React app, create a <GameCanvas /> component that on mount instantiates a Phaser Game targeting a <div> ref.

Build different Phaser scenes that correspond to “areas” of your site (About, Projects, Blog, Contact).

When the player sprite overlaps a certain tile/zone, pause the game and render the corresponding React overlay/modal with your usual page content.

Styling
Tailwind CSS

Why: Utility-first, highly customizable, you already know it.

Setup:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
Then point your tailwind.config.js at src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}.

Content & data
Since GitHub Pages only serves static files, you have two main approaches:

MDX files for sections you want non-game visitors to crawl.

Use vite-plugin-mdx to import markdown (and embed React) as pages that your “portal” scenes load.

Pure JSON for structured data (your resume, project list, blog post metadata), loaded at runtime with fetch(…).

Contact form / dynamic bits
If you need a working contact form, you can’t host server code on Pages. Two easy options:

Formspree or Getform: point your <form action="…"> at their endpoint.

Serverless (optional): deploy Netlify Functions or Vercel Serverless alongside; call via XHR/fetch from your Phaser scene.

Deployment
Add a homepage field in your package.json:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "homepage": "https://<your-gh-username>.github.io/<repo-name>"
}
Install the GH-Pages helper:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
Add scripts:

json
Copy
Edit
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy":   "gh-pages -d dist"
}
Publish:

bash
Copy
Edit
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
git add .
git commit -m "Init"
npm run deploy
(Optional) CI/CD:
Use a simple GitHub Actions workflow to run npm ci && npm run deploy on pushes to main.

Folder structure suggestion
java
Copy
Edit
my-platformer/
├─ public/           ← static assets (images, tilemaps, favicon…)
├─ src/
│  ├─ assets/        ← preloaded spritesheets, maps
│  ├─ game/          ← Phaser scenes & config
│  ├─ components/    ← React UI overlays, navbar, modals
│  ├─ data/          ← JSON/MDX content
│  ├─ App.tsx
│  └─ main.tsx
├─ tailwind.config.js
├─ vite.config.ts
└─ package.json
Why this works for GitHub Pages
100% static: all your code, assets and content build down to HTML/CSS/JS in dist/.

No runtime server: Phaser runs in the browser, React overlays render client-side.

Easy deploy: gh-pages pushes straight into gh-pages branch.

Scalable: want a blog next? Drop in MDX, add a scene portal, and you’re done.

With that stack you get:

A snappy dev feedback loop via Vite.

A full‐featured 2D platformer engine in Phaser.

Rock-solid UI and styling in React + Tailwind.

A zero-cost, zero-server host on GitHub Pages.
